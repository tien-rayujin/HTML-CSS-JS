	meta element include name and content attribute which help SEO

	+ use with <a> to either link to component at current page #contact, or other page product.html#productList

<dl> : description list tag
<dt> : description title
<dd> : description definition



<code> define text code in different format (with font monospace)

cite attribute can use in an other element called inline cite

<address> :
 - Telephone: Tel
 - Email: Email
 - Page written by : <a>




<code>
<pre> : code block, remain whitespace
<var> : variable
<kbd> : keyboard
<samp> : output



<time>

Website Structure:
- <header> header - can also used in <article, section> to mark the header
- <nav> navigation
- <aside> sidebar - often placed in <main>
- <main> main content - main per page
- <footer> footer: sometimes help SEO


- <article> : related content
- <section> : group part




- <div> <span> + class : group element for uses of CSS or JS

<img>
if specific width and height of <img> then browser interpreter it as empty block if img is not loaded yet before page and remain page structure
 - attribute: src, alt, width, heigth, title is good practice
